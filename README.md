CLEANUP
=======
- All messaging goes in a config, can be overridden by games
- Move some functionality outside of App where purely functional
- Descriptions, etc could have the real entity piped through
- Terse versions of all builder functions
- HasEntityID to let us use funcs with ids or things?

TODAY
=====
- less verbose game creation
- queries - what is X
- inventory management as helper func - to add, remove etc
- more verbs, even if non functional
- testing strategy - cmd sequences that should work and get to certain states
- break things - with a broken status
