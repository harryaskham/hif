TODO
=======
- All messaging goes in a config, can be overridden by games
- Move some functionality outside of App where purely functional
- queries - what is X
- more verbs, even if non functional
- break things - with a broken status

TODAY
=====
- Move away from logT by incorporating Writer, and having the main loop do the flushing out of messages - no IO!
