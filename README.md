# hif

- Game has state, player has state
- Game is series of locations with descriptions + verbose toggle etc
- Player inventory
- Lexer/parser for player instructions, could go quite advanced here
- Passage of time (either since events or since start)
- Locatinos have conditionals that must be met, might cross-ref other things
- For this, need notion of global entity map
- Story beats - predicate reveal of additional information based on actions - how to encode branching path?
- Unlimited UNDO should be possible
