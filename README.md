## TODO
- Passage of time (either since events or since start)
- Unlimited UNDO via state stack
- Global set of predicates that are run every turn to modify the game
- Alerting system that always appears in the current description.
- First time you visit a location you get the verbose description

## Outline
awake on day 912 of quarantine - it's a monday
alone with one night stand?
message on radio from BJ simulacra hoping to keep deaths under X, virus mutated Y times
knocking at the door (requires alert mechanism)
physical alarm going off - 6:30am
need predicate system - globally and per-room in the descriptions
radio message proceeds as time passes and you move through the place
full descriptions only appear first time you go into a room

if you don't get to the door in time, you miss your ration delivery - game over

it's dark - lightswitches dont work, already used up 30m of electricity last night.
only power goes to the terminal

get to the door, obtain rations from Class 3 citizen - dual-use, allow player to eat them but warn they might need that later...
only game-over it later on if they've accidentally eaten the thing
front door won't actually open though - locked shut with external controls
global predicate has person disappear once rations taken

use physical alarm to hint at workday starting at 7am sharp - no commute
suit detector will check if player is fully washed and clothed
player works as neighbourhood quarantine enforcer, combing through footage looking for Class 1 or 3 citizens closer than 2 metres apart

go to bathroom to wash and back to bedroom to dress
go to living room

window view shows army of Class 3s delivering rations - some collapsing. Fewer than yesterday.
use terminal
power suddenly cuts out! that must be the government line. You hear a clunk come from the front door lock.

player leaves without n95 mask on - ushered back inside by police, but the temporary exposure gives symptoms. a week later, bulbous sores erupt on back and legs, and lungs fill with fetid blood. ded

player wears n95 and can now leave the house behind. milestone 1

- TODO: Achievements for weird trhigs - radio in the bathtub
- things can contain other things, maybe?
- more forgiving verb/noun combos
- whether on/off in inventory display
- clothing status for player / bathing status for player? wearing things like suits, masks
