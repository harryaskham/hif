# hif

## TODO
- more forgiving verb/noun combos
- whether on/off in inventory display
- break things - with a broken status
- synechdoche stuff - look under lid, for example

- Achievements for weird trhigs - alarm in the bathtub
- repeat the mantra on the radio for special ending
- look at things shows things in them
- queries - what is X
- more verbs
- Endgame triggers


CLEANUP
=======
Remove specificity of things
- All messaging goes in a config, can be overridden by games
- Humans have talk-triggers
- Combinations are registered
- In fact, all action potentials are registered and stored
- We should have IDs for items - things more like simpleObj than anything else
- inventory management as helper func
