#+TITLE: TODOs

- [ ] The whole "namedObject" thing is really fragile; have a better way of getting the current view of a given object
  - Like a [x, y, z] = current [x, y, z] refresher
- [ ] Entities as ADTs with classes for e.g. Edible a, Combinable a b, Droppable a
- [ ] Compile with Haste / GHCJS for web deployment
  - Can't use Haste with TemplateHaskell
    - Could remove TH / Lens but this is a lot of work
  - Can't use GHCJS with Stack
- [ ] Build-as-you-play mode?
  - Make it easy to build the barebones of the game
  - Entity descriptions stored in e.g. SQLite DB
  - Being in a new place lets you set its description
  - Looking at anything creates it, and sets a description
    - e.g. look at [necklace, chain, jewellery] creates those aliases
  - Any action is allowable, and doing it allows it
    - e.g. "eat food" sets food edible, eats it
  - Complex behaviour harder to model here:
    - Handlers
    - Achievements
    - Dialogue
